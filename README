Module/Build/DB version 0.10
============================

This module subclasses Module::Build to provide added functionality for
configuring, building, and testing database-backed applications. It uses a
simple Rails-style numbered migration scheme, although migration scripts are
written in pure SQL, not Perl.

Frankly, this isn't a great module. Some reasons:

* The numbered method of tracking migration dependencies has very little
  flexibility.

* Subclassing Module::Build is a really bad way to extend the build system,
  because you can't really mix in other build features.

Someday, I hope to fix the first issue by looking more closely at [database
change
management](http://www.justatheory.com/computers/databases/change-management.html),
and perhaps by adopting a [completely different
approach](http://www.depesz.com/index.php/2010/08/22/versioning/). The latter
problem I would likely solve by completely separating the migration code from
the build system, and then integrating as appropriate (hopefully Module::Build
will get proper plugins someday).

But in the meantime, I have working code that depends on this simple
implementation (which does support [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/),
[SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) and [MySQL](ttp://www.mysql.com/)), and I
want it to be easy for people to get at this dependency. So here we are.
